### Hi, I'm Severen!

I am a third year BSc student majoring in mathematics and computer science at the
[University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

My interests include:
+ Programming language theory, design, and implementation
+ Logic, type theory, and category theory
+ Abstract algebra

I am an avid user, developer, and supporter of [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
and [open source](https://opensource.org/osd) software, and as such endeavour to release as many of my
projects as possible under such licences.

You can contact me via email at `severen.redwood@gmail.com`, on Discord at `severen#1442`, or on Twitter at
[@severenr_](https://twitter.com/severenr_/).

<!-- TODO: Add this when I actually get my website up and running -->
<!-- Everything about me and my projects are also available on [my website](https://example.org/). -->
