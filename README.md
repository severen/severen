### Hi, I'm Severen!

I am a systems developer at [SiteHost](https://sitehost.nz/) and a mathematics
and computer science graduate from the [University of
Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

My interests include:
+ Programming language theory, design, and implementation
+ Logic, type theory, and category theory
+ Abstract algebra

I am an avid user, developer, and supporter of
[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [open
source](https://opensource.org/osd) software, and as such endeavour to release
as many of my projects as possible under such licences.

Want to chat? Send an email to [`sev@severen.dev`](mailto:severen@severen.dev),
or if messaging is more your speed, you can find me under `@severen:mtrx.nz` on
[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and
