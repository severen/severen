### Hi, I'm Severen!

I am a systems developer at [SiteHost](https://sitehost.nz/) and a mathematics
and computer science graduate from the [University of
Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

My interests include:
+ Programming language theory, design, and implementation
+ Logic, type theory, and category theory
+ Abstract algebra

I am an avid user, developer, and supporter of
[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [open
source](https://opensource.org/osd) software, and as such endeavour to release
as many of my projects as possible under such licences.

You can contact me via email at `sev@severen.dev` or on Discord at `severen#1442`.

<!-- TODO: Add this when I actually get my website up and running -->
<!-- Everything about me and my projects are also available on [my website](https://example.org/). -->
